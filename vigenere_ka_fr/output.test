FAR OUT IN THE UNCHARTED BACKWATERS OF THE UNFASHIONABLE  END  OF
THE  WESTERN  SPIRAL  ARM  OF  THE GALAXY LIES A SMALL UNREGARDED
YELLOW SUN.

ORBITING THIS AT A DISTANCE OF ROUGHLY NINETY-TWO  MILLION  MILES
IS  AN  UTTERLY INSIGNIFICANT LITTLE BLUE GREEN PLANET WHOSE APE-
DESCENDED LIFE FORMS ARE SO AMAZINGLY PRIMITIVE THAT  THEY  STILL
THINK DIGITAL WATCHES ARE A PRETTY NEAT IDEA.

THIS PLANET HAS - OR RATHER HAD - A PROBLEM, WHICH WAS THIS: MOST
OF  THE  PEOPLE  ON  IT WERE UNHAPPY FOR PRETTY MUCH OF THE TIME.
MANY SOLUTIONS WERE SUGGESTED FOR THIS PROBLEM, BUT MOST OF THESE
WERE  LARGELY  CONCERNED WITH THE MOVEMENTS OF SMALL GREEN PIECES
OF PAPER, WHICH IS ODD BECAUSE ON THE WHOLE IT WASN'T  THE  SMALL
GREEN PIECES OF PAPER THAT WERE UNHAPPY.

AND SO THE PROBLEM REMAINED; LOTS OF THE PEOPLE  WERE  MEAN,  AND
MOST OF THEM WERE MISERABLE, EVEN THE ONES WITH DIGITAL WATCHES.

MANY WERE INCREASINGLY OF THE OPINION THAT THEY'D ALL MADE A  BIG
MISTAKE  IN  COMING  DOWN  FROM THE TREES IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND
SOME SAID THAT EVEN THE TREES HAD BEEN A BAD MOVE,  AND  THAT  NO
ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE LEFT THE OCEANS.

AND THEN, ONE THURSDAY, NEARLY TWO THOUSAND YEARS AFTER  ONE  MAN
HAD  BEEN NAILED TO A TREE FOR SAYING HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE TO BE
NICE TO PEOPLE FOR A CHANGE, ONE GIRL SITTING ON  HER  OWN  IN  A
SMALL  CAFE  IN  RICKMANSWORTH SUDDENLY REALIZED WHAT IT WAS THAT
HAD BEEN GOING WRONG ALL THIS TIME, AND SHE FINALLY KNEW HOW  THE
WORLD  COULD  BE  MADE  A  GOOD AND HAPPY PLACE. THIS TIME IT WAS
RIGHT, IT WOULD WORK, AND NO ONE WOULD  HAVE  TO  GET  NAILED  TO
ANYTHING.

SADLY, HOWEVER, BEFORE SHE COULD GET TO A PHONE  TO  TELL  ANYONE
ABOUT  IT,  A  TERRIBLY STUPID CATASTROPHE OCCURRED, AND THE IDEA
WAS LOST FOREVER.

THIS IS NOT HER STORY.

BUT IT IS THE STORY OF THAT TERRIBLE STUPID CATASTROPHE AND  SOME
OF ITS CONSEQUENCES.

IT IS ALSO THE STORY OF A BOOK, A BOOK CALLED THE  HITCH  HIKER'S
GUIDE  TO  THE  GALAXY  -  NOT  AN EARTH BOOK, NEVER PUBLISHED ON
EARTH, AND UNTIL THE TERRIBLE CATASTROPHE OCCURRED, NEVER SEEN OR
HEARD OF BY ANY EARTHMAN.

NEVERTHELESS, A WHOLLY REMARKABLE BOOK.

IN FACT IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST REMARKABLE BOOK EVER TO COME OUT
OF  THE  GREAT  PUBLISHING  HOUSES  OF  URSA  MINOR - OF WHICH NO
EARTHMAN HAD EVER HEARD EITHER.

NOT ONLY IS IT A WHOLLY REMARKABLE BOOK,  IT  IS  ALSO  A  HIGHLY
SUCCESSFUL  ONE  -  MORE  POPULAR  THAN  THE  CELESTIAL HOME CARE
OMNIBUS, BETTER SELLING THAN FIFTY MORE  THINGS  TO  DO  IN  ZERO
GRAVITY, AND MORE CONTROVERSIAL THAN OOLON COLLUPHID'S TRILOGY OF
PHILOSOPHICAL BLOCKBUSTERS WHERE GOD WENT  WRONG,  SOME  MORE  OF
GOD'S GREATEST MISTAKES AND WHO IS THIS GOD PERSON ANYWAY?

IN MANY OF THE MORE RELAXED CIVILIZATIONS ON  THE  OUTER  EASTERN
RIM OF THE GALAXY, THE HITCH HIKER'S GUIDE HAS ALREADY SUPPLANTED
THE GREAT ENCYCLOPEDIA GALACTICA AS THE  STANDARD  REPOSITORY  OF
ALL  KNOWLEDGE  AND  WISDOM, FOR THOUGH IT HAS MANY OMISSIONS AND
CONTAINS MUCH THAT IS APOCRYPHAL, OR AT LEAST WILDLY  INACCURATE,
IT  SCORES  OVER THE OLDER, MORE PEDESTRIAN WORK IN TWO IMPORTANT
RESPECTS.

FIRST, IT IS SLIGHTLY CHEAPER; AND  SECONDLY  IT  HAS  THE  WORDS
DON'T PANIC INSCRIBED IN LARGE FRIENDLY LETTERS ON ITS COVER.

BUT THE STORY OF THIS TERRIBLE, STUPID THURSDAY, THE STORY OF ITS
EXTRAORDINARY   CONSEQUENCES,   AND   THE  STORY   OF  HOW  THESE
CONSEQUENCES ARE INEXTRICABLY INTERTWINED  WITH  THIS  REMARKABLE
BOOK BEGINS VERY SIMPLY.

IT BEGINS WITH A HOUSE.

CHAPTER ONE

THE HOUSE STOOD ON A SLIGHT RISE JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE VILLAGE.
IT  STOOD  ON  ITS  OWN  AND  LOOKED  OVER A BROAD SPREAD OF WEST
COUNTRY FARMLAND. NOT A REMARKABLE HOUSE BY ANY MEANS  -  IT  WAS
ABOUT  THIRTY  YEARS OLD, SQUATTISH, SQUARISH, MADE OF BRICK, AND
HAD FOUR WINDOWS SET IN THE FRONT OF A SIZE AND PROPORTION  WHICH
MORE OR LESS EXACTLY FAILED TO PLEASE THE EYE.

THE ONLY PERSON FOR WHOM THE HOUSE WAS IN  ANY  WAY  SPECIAL  WAS
ARTHUR  DENT, AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO BE THE ONE
HE LIVED IN. HE HAD LIVED IN IT FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS, EVER SINCE
HE  HAD  MOVED  OUT  OF  LONDON  BECAUSE  IT MADE HIM NERVOUS AND
IRRITABLE. HE WAS ABOUT THIRTY AS WELL,  DARK  HAIRED  AND  NEVER
QUITE AT EASE WITH HIMSELF. THE THING THAT USED TO WORRY HIM MOST
WAS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS USED  TO  ASK  HIM  WHAT  HE  WAS
LOOKING  SO  WORRIED  ABOUT.  HE  WORKED  IN LOCAL RADIO WHICH HE
ALWAYS USED TO TELL HIS FRIENDS WAS A LOT MORE  INTERESTING  THAN
THEY  PROBABLY  THOUGHT. IT WAS, TOO - MOST OF HIS FRIENDS WORKED
IN ADVERTISING.

IT HADN'T PROPERLY REGISTERED WITH ARTHUR THAT THE COUNCIL WANTED
TO KNOCK DOWN HIS HOUSE AND BUILD AN BYPASS INSTEAD.

AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY  MORNING  ARTHUR  DIDN'T  FEEL  VERY
GOOD.  HE  WOKE  UP BLEARILY, GOT UP, WANDERED BLEARILY ROUND HIS
ROOM, OPENED A WINDOW, SAW A BULLDOZER, FOUND HIS  SLIPPERS,  AND
STOMPED OFF TO THE BATHROOM TO WASH.

TOOTHPASTE ON THE BRUSH - SO. SCRUB.

SHAVING MIRROR - POINTING AT THE CEILING. HE ADJUSTED IT.  FOR  A
MOMENT  IT  REFLECTED  A  SECOND  BULLDOZER  THROUGH THE BATHROOM
WINDOW. PROPERLY ADJUSTED, IT REFLECTED ARTHUR  DENT'S  BRISTLES.
HE SHAVED THEM OFF, WASHED, DRIED, AND STOMPED OFF TO THE KITCHEN
TO FIND SOMETHING PLEASANT TO PUT IN HIS MOUTH.

KETTLE, PLUG, FRIDGE, MILK, COFFEE. YAWN.

THE WORD BULLDOZER WANDERED THROUGH HIS  MIND  FOR  A  MOMENT  IN
SEARCH OF SOMETHING TO CONNECT WITH.

THE BULLDOZER OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN WINDOW WAS QUITE A BIG ONE.

HE STARED AT IT.

"YELLOW," HE THOUGHT AND STOMPED OFF BACK TO HIS BEDROOM  TO  GET
DRESSED.

PASSING THE BATHROOM HE STOPPED TO DRINK A LARGE GLASS OF  WATER,
AND  ANOTHER.  HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT HE WAS HUNG OVER. WHY WAS
HE HUNG OVER? HAD HE BEEN DRINKING THE NIGHT BEFORE? HE  SUPPOSED
THAT  HE MUST HAVE BEEN. HE CAUGHT A GLINT IN THE SHAVING MIRROR.
"YELLOW," HE THOUGHT AND STOMPED ON TO THE BEDROOM.

HE STOOD AND THOUGHT. THE PUB, HE THOUGHT. OH DEAR, THE  PUB.  HE
VAGUELY REMEMBERED BEING ANGRY, ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT SEEMED
IMPORTANT. HE'D BEEN TELLING  PEOPLE  ABOUT  IT,  TELLING  PEOPLE
ABOUT  IT  AT  GREAT  LENGTH,  HE  RATHER SUSPECTED: HIS CLEAREST
VISUAL RECOLLECTION WAS OF GLAZED LOOKS ON OTHER PEOPLE'S  FACES.
SOMETHING  ABOUT A NEW BYPASS HE HAD JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT. IT HAD
BEEN IN THE PIPELINE FOR MONTHS ONLY NO ONE SEEMED TO HAVE  KNOWN
ABOUT  IT.  RIDICULOUS.  HE  TOOK  A SWIG OF WATER. IT WOULD SORT
ITSELF OUT, HE'D DECIDED, NO ONE WANTED  A  BYPASS,  THE  COUNCIL
DIDN'T HAVE A LEG TO STAND ON. IT WOULD SORT ITSELF OUT.

GOD WHAT A TERRIBLE HANGOVER IT HAD EARNED HIM THOUGH. HE  LOOKED
AT  HIMSELF  IN  THE  WARDROBE  MIRROR.  HE STUCK OUT HIS TONGUE.
"YELLOW," HE THOUGHT. THE WORD YELLOW WANDERED THROUGH  HIS  MIND
IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING TO CONNECT WITH.

FIFTEEN SECONDS LATER HE WAS OUT OF THE HOUSE AND LYING IN  FRONT
OF A BIG YELLOW BULLDOZER THAT WAS ADVANCING UP HIS GARDEN PATH.

MR L PROSSER WAS, AS THEY SAY, ONLY HUMAN. IN OTHER WORDS HE  WAS
A CARBON-BASED LIFE FORM DESCENDED FROM AN APE. MORE SPECIFICALLY
HE WAS FORTY, FAT AND SHABBY AND WORKED FOR  THE  LOCAL  COUNCIL.
CURIOUSLY  ENOUGH, THOUGH HE DIDN'T KNOW IT, HE WAS ALSO A DIRECT
MALE-LINE  DESCENDANT  OF  GENGHIS   KHAN,   THOUGH   INTERVENING
GENERATIONS  AND  RACIAL  MIXING HAD SO JUGGLED HIS GENES THAT HE
HAD  NO  DISCERNIBLE  MONGOLOID  CHARACTERISTICS,  AND  THE  ONLY
VESTIGES  LEFT  IN  MR  L  PROSSER  OF HIS MIGHTY ANCESTRY WERE A
PRONOUNCED STOUTNESS ABOUT THE TUM AND A PREDILECTION FOR  LITTLE
FUR HATS.

HE WAS BY NO MEANS A GREAT WARRIOR: IN  FACT  HE  WAS  A  NERVOUS
WORRIED  MAN.  TODAY  HE  WAS  PARTICULARLY  NERVOUS  AND WORRIED
BECAUSE SOMETHING HAD GONE SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH HIS JOB  -  WHICH
WAS  TO  SEE  THAT ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE GOT CLEARED OUT OF THE WAY
BEFORE THE DAY WAS OUT.

"COME OFF IT, MR DENT,", HE SAID, "YOU CAN'T WIN  YOU  KNOW.  YOU
CAN'T  LIE  IN  FRONT OF THE BULLDOZER INDEFINITELY." HE TRIED TO
MAKE HIS EYES BLAZE FIERCELY BUT THEY JUST WOULDN'T DO IT.

ARTHUR LAY IN THE MUD AND SQUELCHED AT HIM.

"I'M GAME," HE SAID, "WE'LL SEE WHO RUSTS FIRST."

"I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCEPT IT," SAID  MR  PROSSER
GRIPPING  HIS  FUR  HAT AND ROLLING IT ROUND THE TOP OF HIS HEAD,
"THIS BYPASS HAS GOT TO BE BUILT AND IT'S GOING TO BE BUILT!"

"FIRST I'VE HEARD OF IT," SAID ARTHUR,  "WHY'S  IT  GOING  TO  BE
BUILT?"

MR PROSSER SHOOK HIS FINGER AT HIM FOR A BIT,  THEN  STOPPED  AND
PUT IT AWAY AGAIN.

"WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHY'S IT GOT TO BE BUILT?" HE  SAID.  "IT'S  A
BYPASS. YOU'VE GOT TO BUILD BYPASSES."

BYPASSES ARE DEVICES WHICH ALLOW SOME PEOPLE TO DRIVE FROM  POINT
A  TO  POINT B VERY FAST WHILST OTHER PEOPLE DASH FROM POINT B TO
POINT A VERY FAST. PEOPLE  LIVING  AT  POINT  C,  BEING  A  POINT
DIRECTLY  IN  BETWEEN,  ARE OFTEN GIVEN TO WONDER WHAT'S SO GREAT
ABOUT POINT A THAT SO MANY PEOPLE OF POINT B ARE SO KEEN  TO  GET
THERE,  AND  WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT POINT B THAT SO MANY PEOPLE OF
POINT A ARE SO KEEN TO GET THERE. THEY  OFTEN  WISH  THAT  PEOPLE
WOULD  JUST  ONCE AND FOR ALL WORK OUT WHERE THE HELL THEY WANTED
TO BE.

MR PROSSER WANTED TO BE AT POINT D. POINT D  WASN'T  ANYWHERE  IN
PARTICULAR, IT WAS JUST ANY CONVENIENT POINT A VERY LONG WAY FROM
POINTS A, B AND C. HE WOULD HAVE A NICE LITTLE COTTAGE  AT  POINT
D,  WITH  AXES OVER THE DOOR, AND SPEND A PLEASANT AMOUNT OF TIME
AT POINT E, WHICH WOULD BE THE NEAREST PUB TO POINT D.  HIS  WIFE
OF  COURSE  WANTED  CLIMBING ROSES, BUT HE WANTED AXES. HE DIDN'T
KNOW WHY - HE  JUST  LIKED  AXES.  HE  FLUSHED  HOTLY  UNDER  THE
DERISIVE GRINS OF THE BULLDOZER DRIVERS.

HE SHIFTED HIS WEIGHT FROM FOOT  TO  FOOT,  BUT  IT  WAS  EQUALLY
UNCOMFORTABLE  ON  EACH.  OBVIOUSLY SOMEBODY HAD BEEN APPALLINGLY
INCOMPETENT AND HE HOPED TO GOD IT WASN'T HIM.

MR PROSSER SAID: "YOU WERE QUITE ENTITLED TO MAKE ANY SUGGESTIONS
OR PROTESTS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME YOU KNOW."

"APPROPRIATE TIME?" HOOTED ARTHUR. "APPROPRIATE TIME? THE FIRST I
KNEW  ABOUT IT WAS WHEN A WORKMAN ARRIVED AT MY HOME YESTERDAY. I
ASKED HIM IF HE'D COME TO CLEAN THE WINDOWS AND HE SAID  NO  HE'D
COME  TO  DEMOLISH  THE HOUSE. HE DIDN'T TELL ME STRAIGHT AWAY OF
COURSE. OH NO. FIRST HE WIPED A COUPLE OF WINDOWS AND CHARGED  ME
A FIVER. THEN HE TOLD ME."

"BUT MR DENT, THE PLANS HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE IN THE LOCAL PLANNING
OFFICE FOR THE LAST NINE MONTH."

"OH YES, WELL AS SOON AS I HEARD I WENT  STRAIGHT  ROUND  TO  SEE
THEM,  YESTERDAY  AFTERNOON.  YOU HADN'T EXACTLY GONE OUT OF YOUR
WAY TO CALL ATTENTION TO THEM  HAD  YOU?  I  MEAN  LIKE  ACTUALLY
TELLING ANYBODY OR ANYTHING."

"BUT THE PLANS WERE ON DISPLAY ..."

"ON DISPLAY? I EVENTUALLY HAD TO GO DOWN TO THE  CELLAR  TO  FIND
THEM."

"THAT'S THE DISPLAY DEPARTMENT."

"WITH A TORCH."

"AH, WELL THE LIGHTS HAD PROBABLY GONE."

"SO HAD THE STAIRS."

"BUT LOOK, YOU FOUND THE NOTICE DIDN'T YOU?"

"YES," SAID ARTHUR, "YES I DID. IT WAS ON DISPLAY IN  THE  BOTTOM
OF  A  LOCKED  FILING  CABINET STUCK IN A DISUSED LAVATORY WITH A
SIGN ON THE DOOR SAYING BEWARE OF THE LEOPARD."

A CLOUD PASSED OVERHEAD. IT CAST A SHADOW OVER ARTHUR DENT AS  HE
LAY  PROPPED  UP  ON  HIS ELBOW IN THE COLD MUD. IT CAST A SHADOW
OVER ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE. MR PROSSER FROWNED AT IT.

"IT'S NOT AS IF IT'S A PARTICULARLY NICE HOUSE," HE SAID.

"I'M SORRY, BUT I HAPPEN TO LIKE IT."

"YOU'LL LIKE THE BYPASS."

"OH SHUT UP," SAID ARTHUR DENT. "SHUT UP AND GO  AWAY,  AND  TAKE
YOUR  BLOODY  BYPASS  WITH YOU. YOU HAVEN'T GOT A LEG TO STAND ON
AND YOU KNOW IT."

MR PROSSER'S MOUTH OPENED AND CLOSED A COUPLE OF TIMES WHILE  HIS
MIND  WAS  FOR  A  MOMENT  FILLED  WITH INEXPLICABLE BUT TERRIBLY
ATTRACTIVE VISIONS OF ARTHUR DENT'S  HOUSE  BEING  CONSUMED  WITH
FIRE  AND  ARTHUR HIMSELF RUNNING SCREAMING FROM THE BLAZING RUIN
WITH AT LEAST THREE HEFTY SPEARS PROTRUDING  FROM  HIS  BACK.  MR
PROSSER  WAS OFTEN BOTHERED WITH VISIONS LIKE THESE AND THEY MADE
HIM FEEL VERY NERVOUS. HE STUTTERED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN  PULLED
HIMSELF TOGETHER.

"MR DENT," HE SAID.

"HELLO? YES?" SAID ARTHUR.

"SOME FACTUAL INFORMATION FOR YOU. HAVE YOU  ANY  IDEA  HOW  MUCH
DAMAGE THAT BULLDOZER WOULD SUFFER IF I JUST LET IT ROLL STRAIGHT
OVER YOU?"

"HOW MUCH?" SAID ARTHUR.

"NONE AT  ALL,"  SAID  MR  PROSSER,  AND  STORMED  NERVOUSLY  OFF
WONDERING WHY HIS BRAIN WAS FILLED WITH A THOUSAND HAIRY HORSEMEN
ALL SHOUTING AT HIM.

BY A CURIOUS  COINCIDENCE,  NONE  AT  ALL  IS  EXACTLY  HOW  MUCH
SUSPICION  THE  APE-DESCENDANT  ARTHUR  DENT  HAD THAT ONE OF HIS
CLOSEST FRIENDS WAS NOT DESCENDED FROM AN APE, BUT  WAS  IN  FACT
FROM  A  SMALL  PLANET IN THE VICINITY OF BETELGEUSE AND NOT FROM
GUILDFORD AS HE USUALLY CLAIMED.

ARTHUR DENT HAD NEVER, EVER SUSPECTED THIS.

THIS FRIEND OF HIS HAD FIRST ARRIVED ON THE PLANET  SOME  FIFTEEN
EARTH  YEARS  PREVIOUSLY, AND HE HAD WORKED HARD TO BLEND HIMSELF
INTO EARTH SOCIETY - WITH, IT MUST BE  SAID,  SOME  SUCCESS.  FOR
INSTANCE HE HAD SPENT THOSE FIFTEEN YEARS PRETENDING TO BE AN OUT
OF WORK ACTOR, WHICH WAS PLAUSIBLE ENOUGH.

HE HAD MADE ONE CARELESS BLUNDER THOUGH, BECAUSE HE HAD SKIMPED A
BIT  ON HIS PREPARATORY RESEARCH. THE INFORMATION HE HAD GATHERED
HAD LED HIM TO CHOOSE THE NAME "FORD  PREFECT"  AS  BEING  NICELY
INCONSPICUOUS.

HE WAS NOT CONSPICUOUSLY TALL, HIS FEATURES WERE STRIKING BUT NOT
CONSPICUOUSLY  HANDSOME.  HIS  HAIR  WAS  WIRY  AND GINGERISH AND
BRUSHED BACKWARDS FROM THE TEMPLES. HIS SKIN SEEMED TO BE  PULLED
BACKWARDS  FROM  THE  NOSE. THERE WAS SOMETHING VERY SLIGHTLY ODD
ABOUT HIM, BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT IT  WAS.  PERHAPS  IT
WAS  THAT  HIS EYES DIDN'T BLINK OFTEN ENOUGH AND WHEN YOU TALKED
TO HIM FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME YOUR EYES  BEGAN  INVOLUNTARILY  TO
WATER  ON  HIS BEHALF. PERHAPS IT WAS THAT HE SMILED SLIGHTLY TOO
BROADLY AND GAVE PEOPLE THE  UNNERVING  IMPRESSION  THAT  HE  WAS
ABOUT TO GO FOR THEIR NECK.

HE STRUCK MOST OF  THE  FRIENDS  HE  HAD  MADE  ON  EARTH  AS  AN
ECCENTRIC,  BUT  A  HARMLESS  ONE  --  AN UNRULY BOOZER WITH SOME
ODDISH HABITS. FOR INSTANCE HE WOULD OFTEN  GATECRASH  UNIVERSITY
PARTIES,   GET   BADLY   DRUNK   AND  START  MAKING  FUN  OF  ANY
ASTROPHYSICIST HE COULD FIND TILL HE GOT THROWN OUT.

SOMETIMES HE WOULD GET SEIZED WITH  ODDLY  DISTRACTED  MOODS  AND
STARE  INTO THE SKY AS IF HYPNOTIZED UNTIL SOMEONE ASKED HIM WHAT
HE WAS DOING. THEN HE WOULD START GUILTILY FOR  A  MOMENT,  RELAX
AND GRIN.

"OH, JUST LOOKING FOR FLYING SAUCERS," HE WOULD JOKE AND EVERYONE
WOULD  LAUGH  AND  ASK  HIM  WHAT  SORT  OF FLYING SAUCERS HE WAS
LOOKING FOR.

"GREEN ONES!" HE WOULD REPLY WITH A WICKED GRIN, LAUGH WILDLY FOR
A  MOMENT  AND THEN SUDDENLY LUNGE FOR THE NEAREST BAR AND BUY AN
ENORMOUS ROUND OF DRINKS.

EVENINGS LIKE THIS USUALLY ENDED BADLY. FORD WOULD GET OUT OF HIS
SKULL  ON WHISKY, HUDDLE INTO A CORNER WITH SOME GIRL AND EXPLAIN
TO HER IN SLURRED PHRASES THAT HONESTLY THE COLOUR OF THE  FLYING
SAUCERS DIDN'T MATTER THAT MUCH REALLY.

THEREAFTER, STAGGERING SEMI-PARALYTIC DOWN THE NIGHT  STREETS  HE
WOULD  OFTEN  ASK  PASSING  POLICEMEN  IF  THEY  KNEW  THE WAY TO
BETELGEUSE. THE  POLICEMEN  WOULD  USUALLY  SAY  SOMETHING  LIKE,
"DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU WENT OFF HOME SIR?"

"I'M TRYING TO BABY, I'M TRYING  TO,"  IS  WHAT  FORD  INVARIABLY
REPLIED ON THESE OCCASIONS.

IN FACT WHAT HE  WAS  REALLY  LOOKING  OUT  FOR  WHEN  HE  STARED
DISTRACTEDLY  INTO THE NIGHT SKY WAS ANY KIND OF FLYING SAUCER AT
ALL. THE REASON HE SAID GREEN WAS THAT GREEN WAS THE  TRADITIONAL
SPACE LIVERY OF THE BETELGEUSE TRADING SCOUTS.

FORD PREFECT WAS DESPERATE THAT ANY FLYING SAUCER  AT  ALL  WOULD
ARRIVE SOON BECAUSE FIFTEEN YEARS WAS A LONG TIME TO GET STRANDED
ANYWHERE, PARTICULARLY SOMEWHERE AS  MINDBOGGINGLY  DULL  AS  THE
EARTH.

FORD WISHED THAT A FLYING SAUCER WOULD  ARRIVE  SOON  BECAUSE  HE
KNEW  HOW TO FLAG FLYING SAUCERS DOWN AND GET LIFTS FROM THEM. HE
KNEW HOW TO SEE THE MARVELS OF THE UNIVERSE FOR LESS THAN  THIRTY
ALTAIRAN DOLLARS A DAY.

IN FACT, FORD PREFECT WAS A ROVING  RESEARCHER  FOR  THAT  WHOLLY
REMARKABLE BOOK THE HITCH HIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY.

HUMAN BEINGS ARE GREAT ADAPTORS, AND BY  LUNCHTIME  LIFE  IN  THE
ENVIRONS  OF ARTHUR'S HOUSE HAD SETTLED INTO A STEADY ROUTINE. IT
WAS ARTHUR'S ACCEPTED ROLE TO LIE SQUELCHING IN  THE  MUD  MAKING
OCCASIONAL  DEMANDS TO SEE HIS LAWYER, HIS MOTHER OR A GOOD BOOK;
IT WAS MR PROSSER'S ACCEPTED  ROLE  TO  TACKLE  ARTHUR  WITH  THE
OCCASIONAL  NEW  PLOY  SUCH  AS THE FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TALK, THE
MARCH OF PROGRESS TALK, THE THEY KNOCKED MY HOUSE DOWN  ONCE  YOU
KNOW,  NEVER  LOOKED  BACK  TALK AND VARIOUS OTHER CAJOLERIES AND
THREATS; AND IT WAS THE BULLDOZER DRIVERS' ACCEPTED ROLE  TO  SIT
AROUND  DRINKING  COFFEE AND EXPERIMENTING WITH UNION REGULATIONS
TO SEE HOW THEY COULD  TURN  THE  SITUATION  TO  THEIR  FINANCIAL
ADVANTAGE.

THE EARTH MOVED SLOWLY IN ITS DIURNAL COURSE.

THE SUN WAS BEGINNING TO DRY OUT THE MUD ARTHUR LAY IN.

A SHADOW MOVED ACROSS HIM AGAIN.

"HELLO ARTHUR," SAID THE SHADOW.

ARTHUR LOOKED UP AND SQUINTING INTO THE SUN WAS STARTLED  TO  SEE
FORD PREFECT STANDING ABOVE HIM.

"FORD! HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?"

"FINE," SAID FORD, "LOOK, ARE YOU BUSY?"

"AM I BUSY?" EXCLAIMED ARTHUR. "WELL, I'VE  JUST  GOT  ALL  THESE
BULLDOZERS AND THINGS TO LIE IN FRONT OF BECAUSE THEY'LL KNOCK MY
HOUSE DOWN IF I DON'T, BUT OTHER  THAN  THAT  ...  WELL,  NO  NOT
ESPECIALLY, WHY?"

THEY DON'T HAVE SARCASM ON BETELGEUSE,  AND  FORD  PREFECT  OFTEN
FAILED  TO NOTICE IT UNLESS HE WAS CONCENTRATING. HE SAID, "GOOD,
IS THERE ANYWHERE WE CAN TALK?"

"WHAT?" SAID ARTHUR DENT.

FOR A FEW SECONDS FORD SEEMED TO IGNORE HIM, AND  STARED  FIXEDLY
INTO  THE SKY LIKE A RABBIT TRYING TO GET RUN OVER BY A CAR. THEN
SUDDENLY HE SQUATTED DOWN BESIDE ARTHUR.

"WE'VE GOT TO TALK," HE SAID URGENTLY.

"FINE," SAID ARTHUR, "TALK."

"AND DRINK," SAID FORD. "IT'S VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TALK  AND
DRINK. NOW. WE'LL GO TO THE PUB IN THE VILLAGE."

HE LOOKED INTO THE SKY AGAIN, NERVOUS, EXPECTANT.

"LOOK, DON'T YOU  UNDERSTAND?"  SHOUTED  ARTHUR.  HE  POINTED  AT
PROSSER. "THAT MAN WANTS TO KNOCK MY HOUSE DOWN!"

FORD GLANCED AT HIM, PUZZLED.

"WELL HE CAN DO IT WHILE YOU'RE AWAY CAN'T HE?" HE ASKED.

"BUT I DON'T WANT HIM TO!"

"AH."

"LOOK, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU FORD?" SAID ARTHUR.

"NOTHING. NOTHING'S THE MATTER. LISTEN TO ME - I'VE GOT  TO  TELL
YOU  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU'VE EVER HEARD. I'VE GOT TO TELL
YOU NOW, AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU IN THE SALOON BAR OF THE  HORSE
AND GROOM."

"BUT WHY?"

"BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO NEED A VERY STIFF DRINK."

FORD STARED AT ARTHUR, AND ARTHUR WAS ASTONISHED TO FIND THAT HIS
WILL  WAS  BEGINNING  TO  WEAKEN. HE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THIS WAS
BECAUSE OF AN OLD DRINKING GAME THAT FORD LEARNED TO PLAY IN  THE
HYPERSPACE  PORTS  THAT  SERVED THE MADRANITE MINING BELTS IN THE
STAR SYSTEM OF ORION BETA.

THE GAME WAS NOT UNLIKE THE EARTH GAME CALLED  INDIAN  WRESTLING,
AND WAS PLAYED LIKE THIS:

TWO CONTESTANTS WOULD SIT EITHER SIDE OF A TABLE, WITH A GLASS IN
FRONT OF EACH OF THEM.

BETWEEN THEM  WOULD  BE  PLACED  A  BOTTLE  OF  JANX  SPIRIT  (AS
IMMORTALIZED  IN THAT ANCIENT ORION MINING SONG "OH DON'T GIVE ME
NONE MORE OF THAT OLD JANX SPIRIT/ NO, DON'T  YOU  GIVE  ME  NONE
MORE  OF  THAT  OLD  JANX SPIRIT/ FOR MY HEAD WILL FLY, MY TONGUE
WILL LIE, MY EYES WILL FRY AND I MAY DIE/ WON'T YOU POUR  ME  ONE
MORE OF THAT SINFUL OLD JANX SPIRIT").

EACH OF THE TWO CONTESTANTS WOULD THEN CONCENTRATE THEIR WILL  ON
THE  BOTTLE  AND ATTEMPT TO TIP IT AND POUR SPIRIT INTO THE GLASS
OF HIS OPPONENT - WHO WOULD THEN HAVE TO DRINK IT.

THE BOTTLE WOULD THEN BE  REFILLED.  THE  GAME  WOULD  BE  PLAYED
AGAIN. AND AGAIN.

ONCE YOU STARTED TO LOSE YOU WOULD PROBABLY KEEP LOSING,  BECAUSE
ONE  OF  THE  EFFECTS  OF  JANX  SPIRIT IS TO DEPRESS TELEPSYCHIC
POWER.

AS SOON AS A PREDETERMINED QUANTITY HAD BEEN CONSUMED, THE  FINAL
LOSER  WOULD  HAVE  TO  PERFORM  A  FORFEIT,  WHICH  WAS  USUALLY
OBSCENELY BIOLOGICAL.

FORD PREFECT USUALLY PLAYED TO LOSE.

FORD STARED AT ARTHUR, WHO BEGAN TO THINK  THAT  PERHAPS  HE  DID
WANT TO GO TO THE HORSE AND GROOM AFTER ALL.

"BUT WHAT ABOUT MY HOUSE ...?" HE ASKED PLAINTIVELY.

FORD LOOKED ACROSS TO MR PROSSER, AND SUDDENLY A  WICKED  THOUGHT
STRUCK HIM.

"HE WANTS TO KNOCK YOUR HOUSE DOWN?"

"YES, HE WANTS TO BUILD ..."

"AND HE CAN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE LYING IN FRONT OF THE BULLDOZERS?"

"YES, AND ..."

"I'M SURE WE CAN COME TO SOME ARRANGEMENT,"  SAID  FORD.  "EXCUSE
ME!" HE SHOUTED.

MR PROSSER (WHO WAS ARGUING WITH A SPOKESMAN  FOR  THE  BULLDOZER
DRIVERS  ABOUT  WHETHER  OR  NOT ARTHUR DENT CONSTITUTED A MENTAL
HEALTH HAZARD, AND HOW MUCH THEY  SHOULD  GET  PAID  IF  HE  DID)
LOOKED AROUND. HE WAS SURPRISED AND SLIGHTLY ALARMED TO FIND THAT
ARTHUR HAD COMPANY.

"YES? HELLO?" HE CALLED. "HAS MR DENT COME TO HIS SENSES YET?"

"CAN WE FOR THE MOMENT," CALLED FORD, "ASSUME THAT HE HASN'T?"

"WELL?" SIGHED MR PROSSER.

"AND CAN WE ALSO ASSUME," SAID  FORD,  "THAT  HE'S  GOING  TO  BE
STAYING HERE ALL DAY?"

"SO?"

"SO ALL YOUR MEN ARE GOING TO BE STANDING AROUND  ALL  DAY  DOING
NOTHING?"

"COULD BE, COULD BE ..."

"WELL, IF  YOU'RE  RESIGNED  TO  DOING  THAT  ANYWAY,  YOU  DON'T
ACTUALLY NEED HIM TO LIE HERE ALL THE TIME DO YOU?"

"WHAT?"

"YOU DON'T," SAID FORD PATIENTLY, "ACTUALLY NEED HIM HERE."

MR PROSSER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.

"WELL NO, NOT AS  SUCH...",  HE  SAID,  "NOT  EXACTLY  NEED  ..."
PROSSER  WAS WORRIED. HE THOUGHT THAT ONE OF THEM WASN'T MAKING A
LOT OF SENSE.

FORD SAID, "SO IF YOU WOULD JUST LIKE TO TAKE  IT  AS  READ  THAT
HE'S  ACTUALLY HERE, THEN HE AND I COULD SLIP OFF DOWN TO THE PUB
FOR HALF AN HOUR. HOW DOES THAT SOUND?"

MR PROSSER THOUGHT IT SOUNDED PERFECTLY POTTY.

"THAT SOUNDS PERFECTLY REASONABLE," HE SAID IN A REASSURING  TONE
OF VOICE, WONDERING WHO HE WAS TRYING TO REASSURE.

"AND IF YOU WANT TO POP OFF FOR A QUICK ONE YOURSELF  LATER  ON,"
SAID FORD, "WE CAN ALWAYS COVER UP FOR YOU IN RETURN."

"THANK YOU VERY MUCH," SAID MR PROSSER WHO NO LONGER KNEW HOW  TO
PLAY  THIS  AT  ALL,  "THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YES, THAT'S VERY KIND
..." HE FROWNED, THEN SMILED, THEN TRIED  TO  DO  BOTH  AT  ONCE,
FAILED,  GRASPED HOLD OF HIS FUR HAT AND ROLLED IT FITFULLY ROUND
THE TOP OF HIS HEAD. HE COULD ONLY ASSUME THAT HE HAD JUST WON.

"SO," CONTINUED FORD PREFECT, "IF YOU WOULD  JUST  LIKE  TO  COME
OVER HERE AND LIE DOWN ..."

"WHAT?" SAID MR PROSSER.

"AH, I'M SORRY," SAID FORD, "PERHAPS I HADN'T MADE  MYSELF  FULLY
CLEAR.  SOMEBODY'S  GOT TO LIE IN FRONT OF THE BULLDOZERS HAVEN'T
THEY? OR THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING TO STOP  THEM  DRIVING  INTO  MR
DENT'S HOUSE WILL THERE?"

"WHAT?" SAID MR PROSSER AGAIN.

"IT'S VERY SIMPLE," SAID FORD, "MY CLIENT, MR DENT, SAYS THAT  HE
WILL  STOP  LYING  HERE IN THE MUD ON THE SOLE CONDITION THAT YOU
COME AND TAKE OVER FROM HIM."

"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" SAID ARTHUR, BUT  FORD  NUDGED  HIM
WITH HIS SHOE TO BE QUIET.

"YOU WANT ME," SAID MR PROSSER, SPELLING OUT THIS NEW THOUGHT  TO
HIMSELF, "TO COME AND LIE THERE ..."

"YES."

"IN FRONT OF THE BULLDOZER?"

"YES."

"INSTEAD OF MR DENT."

"YES."

"IN THE MUD."

"IN, AS YOU SAY IT, THE MUD."

AS SOON AS MR PROSSER REALIZED  THAT  HE  WAS  SUBSTANTIALLY  THE
LOSER  AFTER  ALL,  IT  WAS  AS IF A WEIGHT LIFTED ITSELF OFF HIS
SHOULDERS: THIS WAS MORE LIKE THE WORLD AS HE KNEW IT. HE SIGHED.

"IN RETURN FOR WHICH YOU WILL TAKE MR DENT WITH YOU DOWN  TO  THE
PUB?"

"THAT'S IT," SAID FORD. "THAT'S IT EXACTLY."

MR PROSSER TOOK A FEW NERVOUS STEPS FORWARD AND STOPPED.

"PROMISE?"

"PROMISE," SAID FORD. HE TURNED TO ARTHUR.

"COME ON," HE SAID TO HIM, "GET UP AND LET THE MAN LIE DOWN."

ARTHUR STOOD UP, FEELING AS IF HE WAS IN A DREAM.

FORD BECKONED TO PROSSER WHO SADLY, AWKWARDLY, SAT  DOWN  IN  THE
MUD.  HE  FELT  THAT HIS WHOLE LIFE WAS SOME KIND OF DREAM AND HE
SOMETIMES WONDERED WHOSE IT WAS AND WHETHER  THEY  WERE  ENJOYING
IT. THE MUD FOLDED ITSELF ROUND HIS BOTTOM AND HIS ARMS AND OOZED
INTO HIS SHOES.

FORD LOOKED AT HIM SEVERELY.

"AND NO SNEAKY KNOCKING DOWN MR DENT'S HOUSE  WHILST  HE'S  AWAY,
ALRIGHT?" HE SAID.

"THE MERE THOUGHT," GROWLED MR PROSSER,  "HADN'T  EVEN  BEGUN  TO
SPECULATE,"  HE  CONTINUED,  SETTLING  HIMSELF  BACK,  "ABOUT THE
MEREST POSSIBILITY OF CROSSING MY MIND."

HE SAW THE BULLDOZER DRIVER'S  UNION  REPRESENTATIVE  APPROACHING
AND  LET HIS HEAD SINK BACK AND CLOSED HIS EYES. HE WAS TRYING TO
MARSHAL HIS ARGUMENTS FOR PROVING THAT HE DID NOT NOW  CONSTITUTE
A  MENTAL  HEALTH  HAZARD  HIMSELF. HE WAS FAR FROM CERTAIN ABOUT
THIS - HIS MIND SEEMED TO BE FULL OF NOISE,  HORSES,  SMOKE,  AND
THE  STENCH OF BLOOD. THIS ALWAYS HAPPENED WHEN HE FELT MISERABLE
AND PUT UPON, AND HE  HAD  NEVER  BEEN  ABLE  TO  EXPLAIN  IT  TO
HIMSELF.  IN A HIGH DIMENSION OF WHICH WE KNOW NOTHING THE MIGHTY
KHAN BELLOWED WITH RAGE, BUT MR PROSSER  ONLY  TREMBLED  SLIGHTLY
AND WHIMPERED. HE BEGAN TO FELL LITTLE PRICKS OF WATER BEHIND THE
EYELIDS. BUREAUCRATIC COCK-UPS,  ANGRY  MEN  LYING  IN  THE  MUD,
INDECIPHERABLE  STRANGERS  HANDING  OUT INEXPLICABLE HUMILIATIONS
AND AN UNIDENTIFIED ARMY OF HORSEMEN LAUGHING AT HIM IN HIS  HEAD
- WHAT A DAY.

WHAT A DAY. FORD PREFECT KNEW THAT IT DIDN'T  MATTER  A  PAIR  OF
DINGO'S  KIDNEYS  WHETHER  ARTHUR'S HOUSE GOT KNOCKED DOWN OR NOT
NOW.

ARTHUR REMAINED VERY WORRIED.

"BUT CAN WE TRUST HIM?" HE SAID.

"MYSELF I'D TRUST HIM TO THE END OF THE EARTH," SAID FORD.

"OH YES," SAID ARTHUR, "AND HOW FAR'S THAT?"

"ABOUT TWELVE MINUTES AWAY,"  SAID  FORD,  "COME  ON,  I  NEED  A
DRINK."
